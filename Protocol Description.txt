----SIGNAL----
A signal consists of a PREAMBLE, DATA and an END.
Each signal is sent 4 times in a row to increase the delivery success rate.



----PREAMBLE----
send low for 250 microseconds
send high for 2,500 microseconds



----DATA----
26 bits of transmitter id
1 bit indicating if the on signal is targeting a group
1 bit indicating "on" or "off"
4 bits indicating the targeted unit/channel
4 bits indicating a absolute dim level (optional)

Total: 32 or 36 bits depending if absolute dimming is used

Each real bit in the data field is sent over air as a pair of two inverted bits.
  real bit        bits over air
     1       =        "10"
     0       =        "01"

Over air a "1"(one) is sent as:
send low for 250 microseconds
send high for 1,250 microseconds

Over air a "0"(zero) is sent as:
send low for 250 microseconds
send high for 250 microseconds



----END----
send low for 250 microseconds
send high for 10,000 microseconds



----TIMING----
The theoretical time for sending one signal is 77ms (32 bit data) or 85ms (36 bit data).
The total time spent for sending all 4 signals is therefore 308ms / 340ms
Each implementation is unique and will therefore have some drift from the exact timings. 
It is good to expect some variation in the pulse timings (e.g. +/- 200 microseconds).
